## How to Use

1. **Adjust Basic Parameters**:
   - Sides: Controls the symmetry of the pattern
   - Radius: Sets the base size of the pattern
   - Angle Increment: Adds internal lines for more complex patterns
   - Rotation: Rotates the entire pattern

2. **Wave Settings**:
   - Wave Type: Choose from different mathematical functions
   - Frequency: Controls how many waves appear in the pattern
   - Amplitude: Sets the height of the waves
   - Phase: Shifts the waves around the pattern

3. **Secondary Wave** (Optional):
   - Enable the secondary wave for more complex patterns
   - Adjust its parameters independently
   - Choose how to combine it with the primary wave

4. **Animation**:
   - Toggle animation on/off
   - Select what to animate (rotation, frequency, amplitude, or multiple)
   - Adjust animation speed

5. **Export Your Creation**:
   - Click "PNG" to save as an image
   - Click "SVG" for vector format
   - Click "Video" to create an animated version with custom settings
